"""Read a workshop invoice into a draft service visit (never writes one).

The fuel form reads a fuel slip; this reads the paper a workshop hands over:
a service or tax invoice, a job card, a quote. Two paths, like the document
reader it builds on:

* A PDF with a text layer has its text laid out row by row (PyMuPDF words
  grouped by line, so a table row stays one line with its columns in order)
  and sent to the text model (``llm_model``).
* A photo or scanned PDF is OCR'd (Tesseract keeps a table row on one line)
  and the text goes to the same text model. Measured on a 23-line tax
  invoice: OCR + qwen2.5:7b had the workshop, date, odometer, tax and total
  right and 22 lines exact; gemma3:4b reading the images took the customer
  for the workshop and misread the totals.
* Only when OCR finds no text does the file go to the vision model through
  ``document_reader_service.read_document``.

Both need AI document reading (``llm_document_reading_enabled``) and, for a
model outside the household's network, the person's consent: an invoice
carries a name, an address and a phone number.

The model is asked for values as printed. What a small model gets wrong is
which column it copies, so the draft never trusts one column: the lines are
checked against the invoice's own totals (`reconcile`), which says whether
the amounts are before or after tax, and the tax is split back out when the
lines carry it. A draft whose lines don't add up still comes back, with a
warning, for the person to fix before saving.
